## NYC 311 service Bokeh dahboard
This repository contains code and data to run a fully functional Bokeh dashboard. The data itself is not updated live. Rather, it comes from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9 and it has been trimmed down and cleaned.

The dashboard contains the average response time it took for a service request to be resolved in 2020 as a function of the month when the SR was created. Different zipcodes can be selected to adjust the line plot.
